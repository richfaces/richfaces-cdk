			&lt;p&gt;

			MethodExpression representing an action listener method that
			will be notified when this component is activated by the user.
			The expression must evaluate to a public method that takes an
			ActionEvent parameter, with a return type of void, &lt;span
			class="changed_added_2_0"&gt;or to a public method that takes no
			arguments with a return type of void. In the latter case, the
			method has no way of easily knowing where the event came from,
			but this can be useful in cases where a notification is needed
			that "some action happened".&lt;/span&gt;
