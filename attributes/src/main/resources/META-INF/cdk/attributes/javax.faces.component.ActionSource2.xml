			MethodExpression representing the application action to invoke
			when this component is activated by the user. The expression
			must evaluate to a public method that takes no parameters, and
			returns an Object (the toString() of which is called to derive
			the logical outcome) which is passed to the NavigationHandler
			for this application.
